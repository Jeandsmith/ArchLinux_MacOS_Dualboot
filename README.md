# Dual Boot: Arch Linux and MacOS

### 1. Create [bootable USB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media) with Arch ISO
### 2. Disk partition on Mac
  - Open 'Disk Utility' on Mac
  - Select the drive to be partitioned in the left-hand column (not the partitions!). Click on the Partition button.
  - Add a new partition by pressing the + button and choose how much space you want to leave for OS X, and how much for the new partition. Keep in mind the new partition will be formatted in Arch Linux, so you can choose any partition type you want.
  - Boot the Arch installation media by holding down the Alt during boot.
